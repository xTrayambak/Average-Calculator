Thank you for downloading Average Calculator. This is a very simple program made in QBASIC which can calculate average. This can come in handy for teachers.
The .bas file is the source code and the .exe file is the program which can be executed easily without any issues if using the Windows operating system. Feel free to copy.

How to use/modify:
Having a copy of QBASIC is required to modify the code.
If you want to increase the values/marks, just put a value more with a capital "M" starting. Remember to change it everywhere else aswell and change "PER = AVG/5" to get the correct answer since:

Average = Sum of all values divided by number of values.
